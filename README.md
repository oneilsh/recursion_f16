## Recursion and Dynamic Programming workshop, Fall 2016

Since my computer is being a bit flaky currently, I think I'll go the "easy" way out and use a github repo as the class website. There are a few advantages and disadvantages to this--we'll have to take em as we get em. 

You may be curious how you can "sync" this repo (which is essentially just a folder with some files) to your own desktop  (aka "clone"). It's easy! Well, almost: first you will need to install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Next, in RStudio, select File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git. In the Clone URL, enter https://github.com/oneilsh/recursion_f16.git You can use whatever you like for the "project directory name" but I would suggest recursion_f16. You can also browse with the "Browse" button to select where it should be saved.

When contents of this repository are updated (which should be every class day, if I am good about remembering to do so), you can get the latest version by selecting the "Git" button within the RStudio interface (assuming you have the project open in RStudio), and select "Pull Branches".
